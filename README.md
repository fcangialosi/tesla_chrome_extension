Team TESLA Forum Checker Extension 
======================

Google Chrome Extension that periodically polls team forum for new posts and conveniently, yet unobtrusively, displays an unread count in the icon's badge. Also has an option to add on more visible pop-up notifications.


Created by Frank Cangialosi for Gemstone Team TESLA @ University of Maryland, College Park, Spring 2016.
